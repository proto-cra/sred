    <h2 id="h1">First Contact with the Research and Technology Advisor </h2>
<p>After you have submitted a claim for the pre-approval through MYBA,  you can expect to be contacted by a Research and Technology Advisor (RTA) within <strong>3 weeks</strong>. During your first contact, the RTA will contact you by phone. </p> 

<p>The RTA will: </p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Confirm your official language of choice </li>
  <li>Explain the review process </li>
 
    <li>Explain the SR&amp;ED program <a href="">requirements</a>, and how a project(s) can qualify for pre-approval </li>
    <li>Answer your questions about SR&ED pre-approval program requirements </li>
<li>Establish the facts concerning your claim, and identify areas they may require more information, or have questions.</li>
  <li>Set-up an official meeting that will take virtually or on site at a mutually agreed upon date and time, when your staff with in-depth knowledge of the SR&amp;ED work is available.  </li>
  <li>You will receive an initial letter that will summarize what was discussed during the call, as well as: 
  <ul>
    <li>A meeting agenda identifying the issues and related projects to be discussed as well as an estimated amount of time (we estimate this meeting to be about 2 hours) </li>
    <li>Contact information for the reviewers and their managers </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  

 

 




 
  <h2 id="h2">Preparing for the meeting</h2>
<p>Preparing for the meeting is important as it will facilitate the review of your claim. Below are some recommendations to help you prepare: </p> 

 


  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the availability and preparedness of the individuals you chose to participate in the review meeting </li>
    <li>Be prepared to discuss the scientific or technological uncertainties the project is aiming to address, and the work to be carried out during the PCA period to overcome the scientific or the technological uncertainties, including how you plan to structure your systematic investigation or search.</li>
    <li>Ensure you have received the invitation for the virtual meeting </li>
   
  </ul>
  <p>Feel free to contact  the RTA during your preparation if you have any questions about the review process. </p>
  
  <h2 id="h3">Overview of the meeting</h2>
  <p>The meeting will take place <strong>in 4 weeks</strong> after a complete application is received.  The meeting is to be a discussion between the reviewer and company, to provide the RTA with any details required to determine whether the project meets the definition of SR&amp;ED.</p>
   <p>The meeting provides the claimant with the opportunity to share the state of knowledge or technology advances that currently exists and the new knowledge or technological advances being sought through SR&ED. It also provides the opportunity to the claimant to provide details on how they plan to structure the project to ensure an evidence-bases approach is taken. </p>
<p>To better understand your business, a review may request a tour of your place of business or manufacturing premises. This can be done either virtually or on-site. A tour provides an opportunity for the review to visualize and contextualize your business environment.  </p>
   <p>If the tour is being conducted virtually, you can present your work in a virtual manner by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recording or photographing a product or process and sending it to the reviewers </li>
    <li>Presenting slides or other documents through screen sharing during a videoconference </li>
    <li>Using a camera-equipped laptop or mobile device to take the meeting participants on a tour of the facility or show a live <a href="">production run</a> </li>
  </ul>
   <h2 id="h4">At the end of the meeting</h2>
  <p>The reviewer will verbally provide a summary of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Their understanding of the STU and planed approach  to address it</li>
    <li>The clarification that they obtained</li>
    <li>Any areas where they still have concerns and require further clarification (if applicable)</li>
    <li>The preliminary review findings*</li>
    <li>Recommendations for the upcoming claims</li>
  </ul>
   

  

 

 

 
 <h2 id="h5">The CRA completes the review</h2>
