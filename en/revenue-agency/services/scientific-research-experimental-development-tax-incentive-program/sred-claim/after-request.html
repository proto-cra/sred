    </ul>
  <h2 id="h1">Review process and processing time</h2>
  <p>Your pre-claim approval application will be reviewed by a Research and Technology Advisor (RTA). They will first contact you by phone to explain the process and set up a meeting to discuss the proposed work. </p>
  
    <h3>First contact with the Research and Technology Advisor </h3>
<p>Within <strong>2 weeks</strong> after you have submitted your application for pre-claim approval, a Research and Technology Advisor (RTA) will contact the person indicated in line 34 of the application form by phone to: </p> 
 
<ul>
  <li>Confirm your official language of choice </li>
  <li>Explain the pre-claim approval process </li>
    <li>Explain the SR&amp;ED program requirements and how a project can receive pre-claim approval </li>
    <li>Answer your questions about SR&amp;ED pre-claim approval requirements </li>
<li>Discuss any areas that may require more information or clarification</li>
  <li>Set-up a meeting that will take virtually or on site, when your staff with in-depth knowledge of the proposed SR&amp;ED work are available</li>
</ul>
  <p>After the phone call, you will receive a letter that will summarize what was discussed during the call and will provide: 
  <ul>
    <li>An agenda for the upcoming meeting with an estimated time commitment (between 2 to 5 hours) </li>
    <li>Contact information for the Research and Technology Advisor and their manager</li>
  </ul>
 
  <h3>Preparing for the meeting</h3>
  
<p>Preparing for the meeting is important as it will facilitate the review of your claim. We recommend you do the following: </p> 

  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the availability and preparedness of the individuals you choose to participate in the meeting, including the technical expert from the business</li>
    <li>Be prepared to discuss:
      <ul>
        <li>The existing state of knowledge or technology as pertains to your proposed projects</li>
      <li>The scientific or technological uncertainty the project is aiming to address</li>   
 <li>The work to be carried out during the requested pre-claim approval period to overcome the scientific or the technological uncertainty</li>
    <li>How you plan to structure your systematic investigation or search, including initial hypothesis and planned experiments or analyses</li>
  </ul></li>
    <li>Confirm you have received the invitation for the virtual meeting (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  
  <h3>Overview of the meeting</h3>
 
 <p>The meeting will take place within <strong>4 weeks</strong> after we receive your completed application. The meeting will be a discussion between the RTA and the business, to provide the RTA with any details required to determine whether the work in the planned project(s) meets the definition of SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p>To better understand your business, the RTA may request a tour of your place of business or manufacturing premises during the meeting. This can be done either virtually or on-site. A tour provides an opportunity for the RTA to visualize and contextualize your business environment.  </p>
   <p>If the tour is being conducted virtually, you can present your work in a virtual manner by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Presenting slides or other documents through screen sharing during a videoconference </li>
    <li>Using a camera-equipped laptop or mobile device to take the meeting participants on a tour of the facility</li>
  </ul>
  
   <h3>At the end of the meeting</h3>
 
 <p>The RTA will provide a verbal summary of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Their understanding of the scientific or technological uncertainty and your planned systematic investigation or search approach to address it</li>
    <li>The additional information or clarifications they obtained during the meeting</li>
    <li>Any areas where they still have concerns and require further clarification (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Recommendations for future applications or SR&amp;ED claims</li>
  </ul>
 
 <h2 id="h2">Find out if you are approved</h2>
<p>The RTA will communicate their decision to you by phone or videoconference, before sending it to you in writing, about <strong>8 weeks</strong> after your completed application is received. The pre-claim approval report will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide confirmation on whether the projects are granted pre-approval</li>
    <li>Include details and a rationale on the decision, and may provide you with recommendations to help you with future applications or SR&amp;ED claims</li>
  </ul>
<p>If your project is granted pre-claim approval, and over the course of the pre-claim approval period you make material changes to your project(s), we encourage you to reach out to the RTA or <a href="">contact us</a>. 

<h2 id="h3">Disagreeing with the decision </h2> 
  <p>There is no appeal process for pre-claim approval.</p>
<p>If your pre-claim approval is denied and you do not agree with the decision, you can talk with the RTA or their manager to try to resolve any disputes.</p>

 <p>If you make material changes to the proposed project(s), you can either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Re-submit a pre-claim approval application with the changes to the proposed project(s) </li>
    <li>Move forward without pre-claim approval and submit an SR&amp;ED claim for the project after undertaking the work</li>
  </ul>
  
   

  <h2 id="h4">Get support after you apply</h2>
  <p>Call us if you have any questions about the SR&amp;ED program or submitting your pre-claim approval application. </p>
