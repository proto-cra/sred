    </ul>
    <h2 id="h1">Basic steps to claiming</h2>
    <p>To claim SR&amp;ED tax incentives, you will need to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify your eligible work and group it into a project</li>
        <li>Describe the SR&amp;ED work (including the advancement)</li>
        <li>Calculate your SR&amp;ED expenditures</li>
        <li>Claim a deduction and earn an investment tax credit (ITC)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend you submit your SR&amp;ED claim together with your income tax return for the year.</p>
    <p>Be sure to keep all technical and financial documentation that can <a href="#h3">support your claim</a>.</p>
    <h3>Staff involvement you'll need</h3>
    <p>We recommend that businesses involve senior technical and financial personnel in preparing the claim. Having the involvement of staff with in-depth knowledge of the SR&amp;ED work and the company's financial records will help ensure the accuracy of the claim.</p>
    <p>To properly budget the time and resources needed to complete your claim, we encourage you to review the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/sred-eligibility.html">eligibility requirements</a> before you begin.</p>
    <h2 id="h2">SR&amp;ED reporting deadlines</h2>
    <h3 id="deadline">Submit your claim before the deadline</h3>
    <p>The CRA does not accept any changes to a claim after the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline has passed.</p>
    <p>We recommend you submit your SR&amp;ED claim before the reporting deadline and together with your income tax return.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Why send it early</summary>
        <p>Your SR&amp;ED claim can only be processed once the CRA has received your income tax return for the year.</p>
        <p>To avoid delays, submit your SR&amp;ED claim at the same time as your income tax return.</p>
        <p>If you submit your claim at least <strong>90 days</strong> before the SR&amp;ED reporting deadline, it should give the CRA enough time to do an initial review. If any information is missing, we will have time to advise you to modify your claim before the deadline.</p>
    </details>
    <h3>Find out when your SR&amp;ED reporting deadline is</h3>
    <p>Your SR&amp;ED reporting deadline depends on your income tax filing due date. Your filing due date depends on what type of taxpayer you are (individual, corporation, or trust).</p>
