    <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Ask for a reference number</h1>
<p>Before you can submit your pre-claim approval application, you must get a reference number from the CRA.</p>
  <p>When you submit the following web form, the CRA will review your eligibility and contact you to:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">
        <p>Give you a reference number and further instructions</p>
      </li>
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">
        <p>Explain why you do not meet the requirements to apply for pre-claim approval</p>
      </li>
</ul>

 -->
 

<!-- <p>To request a pre-claim approval, you will need to: </p>  
 

 


  <ul>
    <li>Identify what scientific or technological uncertainties the proposed project aims to address</li>
    <li>Describe the due diligence you have conducted to identify and validate the uncertainties the project aims to address</li>
    <li>Describe the work you plan to perform during the PCA period requested, to overcome the scientific or technological uncertainties and how you will structure your investigation according to a Systematic Investigation or Search approach, including initial hypotheses and planned experiments or analysis</li>
  </ul>-->
 <!-- <h2 id="h2">Staff involvement</h2>

 <!-- <p>We recommend that businesses involve senior technical and financial personnel in preparing the claim. Involving staff with in-depth knowledge of the SR&ED work and the company's financial records will help ensure accuracy of the information you provide. </p>
   -->
<!--  <h2 id="h3">Group work into SR&amp;ED projects</h2>-->
   <!-- <h2 id="h4">Supporting documentation</h2>

<!--<p>In addition to the pre-claim approval request form, the CRA will need the following supporting information or documents to make a determination on whether your planned project(s) qualifies as SR&ED before work has started and cost are incurred. </p>
<p>Your documentation must include: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Project planning documents that outline the timeline, key milestones, and major activities</li>
    <li>Description of planned internal controls for tracking SR&ED work and associated expenditures, including documentation practices (contemporaneous record-keeping) throughout the project</li>
    <li>Supporting references and documentation, such as scientific articles, technical papers, meeting minutes, design specifications, system architecture diagrams, photographs, time logs, or any other evidence supporting the eligibility of the proposed project for SR&ED 
</li>
    <li>List of project team members and their respective areas of expertise and qualifications (including potential or prospective project members)</li>
  </ul>-->
   
<!-- <h3 id="h5" class="mrgn-lft-xl">Make sure your pre-claim application is accurate</h3>
 
<!-- <p>Claimants are responsible for the accuracy of the information in their SR&ED pre-claim approval application and SR&ED claim whether they complete the claim themselves or have it done by someone else. </p>
<p>We recommend being proactive with recordkeeping. Maintaining records throughout all phases of your SR&ED work supports the claiming process and may reduce errors in your claim. </p>
