<h2 id="h1">General instructions</h2>

  <p>This application form allows you to provide information that establishes the nature of your planned <a href="">scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED)</a> work. This information enables the CRA to carry out an initial review to establish how the planned work meets the SR&amp;ED eligibility requirements and may allow the CRA to process your application faster. </p>
  <p>We recommend your (senior) personnel, who are familiar with the scientific or technological content of the work, are involved in preparing the application. Involving staff who have in-depth knowledge of the proposed SR&amp;ED work will help ensure the accuracy of the information you provide. </p>

  <h3 class="h5">Use SR&amp;ED definitions when defining your project</h3>
  <p>When you describe the planned work, we recommend that you use the characteristics of the pertinent terms as defined for SR&ED (for example, the definitions of uncertainties, advancement, qualified individuals, etc.). </p>
  <p>For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4088/guide-form-t661-scientific-research-experimental-development-expenditures-claim-guide-form-t661.html#toc13">Definitions for SR&amp;ED projects</a></p>
 <!-- <p>An SR&amp;ED project must fall within the definition of SR&amp;ED contained in the Income Tax Act. An SR&amp;ED project comprises a set of interrelated activities that collectively are necessary to resolve specific <a href="">scientific or technological uncertainties</a> in the attempt to achieve the <a href="">scientific or technological advancements</a> defined for the project. This advancement is pursued through a <a href="">systematic investigation or search</a> in a field of <a href="">science</a> or <a href="">technology</a> by means of <a href="">experiment</a> or <a href="">analysis</a> performed by <a href="">qualified individuals</a>. </p>
  <p>When describing the planned work, we recommend that you follow the above characteristics in defining your SR&amp;ED project. </p>
  <p>Reference: Income Tax Act subsection 248(1); <a href="">Eligibility of Work for SR&amp;ED Investment Tax Credits Policy</a></p>
-->
  
  <h4 class="h5">Provide clear and concise information</h4>
  <p>This is your first opportunity to present the planned work in the context of the SR&amp;ED program. Clear and concise descriptions of the planned work that directly addresseses these questions will enable the CRA to expedite your application. </p>
  <!--<p>There is a word limit for each question in section B. Therefore, your answers should concentrate on the technical facts and should be in the technical language and style of those who understand and are familiar with the planned work. You may include more details in the supporting documents, such as your project plan. </p>-->
