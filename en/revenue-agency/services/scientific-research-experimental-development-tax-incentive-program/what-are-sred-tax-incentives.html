<h2 id="h1">How your business can benefit</h2>
<p>If your business is engaged in scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED), you may be able to earn tax incentives that reduce your income tax payable.</p>
<p>Corporations, individuals, trusts, and partnerships that conduct SR&amp;ED work in Canada may be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Claim a deduction against income</li>
    <li>
        Earn an investment tax credit (ITC) that they can apply against their income tax payable
        <ul>
            <li>Partnerships allocate the ITC earned to their eligible partners</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/business-tax-credits/how-relationships-affect-small-business-deduction-sred-investment-tax-credits.html">How certain relationships affect the small business deduction and SR&amp;ED investment tax credits</a></p>
<h3>Claim a deduction against income</h3>
<p>To claim a deduction against income, you will need to calculate the allowable SR&amp;ED expenditures that you incurred in the year.</p>
<p>You can then calculate your pool of deductible expenditures and use any balance to reduce your net income for the current year or a future year.</p>
<h3>Earn an investment tax credit (ITC)</h3>
<p>You may earn an ITC to reduce your income tax payable for the year.</p>
<p>Your business may earn the credit at a basic rate of 15%. Some corporations may claim an ITC at the enhanced rate of 35%.</p>
<p>Some businesses may also earn a refundable ITC.</p>
<h2>
  <mark>Pre-claim approval</mark>
</h2>
<p>Whether your business is already engaged in scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED), or is planning to undertake such activities, it may qualify for SR&amp;ED pre-claim approval. Before you start any work or incurr any costs, the CRA will assess your application and determine if your project will meet the definition of SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p>The CRA will not assess expenditures during the pre-claim approval process. Expenditures may require a review after you file an SR&amp;ED claim.</p>
<p>You can request pre-claim approval for up to <strong>3 projects</strong> and for a duration for up to <strong>3 years</strong>. </p>
<p>Requesting pre-claim approval is optional. You can still claim a SR&amp;ED tax incentive if you decide not to request pre-claim approval. If you choose to, you will take the following steps to obtain SR&amp;ED tax incentives with pre-claim approval: </p>
  <ol class="lst-stps">
      <li>
    <h3>Ask for a reference number</h3>
     <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
          <li>Submit a short web form to confirm your eligibility for pre-claim approval</li>
          <li>Within one week, the CRA will give you a reference number that will be required to submit your application</li>
        </ol>
  </li>
      <li>
    <h3>Submit your pre-claim approval application</h3>
    <ol class="lst-stps-sub stps-strpd">
          <li>Fill out the application form for your planned SR&amp;ED projects and gather all necessary supporting documents</li>
          <li>Submit your application through My Business Account using the reference number you received in step one</li>
          <li>The CRA will give you a decision about your pre-claim approval within 60 days of receiving the application</li>
        </ol>
</li>
      <li>
    <h3>File your SR&amp;ED claim</h3>
   <ol class="lst-stps-sub stps-strpd">
          <li>After finishing the work, submit your SR&amp;ED claims before the filing deadlines</li>
          <li>Expenditure reviews for claims that only include projects with pre-claim approval will generally be processed within 90 days</li>
        </ol>
  </li>
    </ol>
<!--  <p><mark>If your business is engaged in scientific research and experimental development (SR&amp;ED), you may be eligible for a pre-claim approval. The pre-claim approval (PCA) allows you to request a determination from the CRA on whether your planned project(s) meets the definition of SR&amp;ED, before work has started and costs have been incurred.</mark></p>
  <p><mark>You can request a PCA for up to 3 projects.</mark></p>
  <p><mark>The PCA is not granted on specific expenditures. The CRA will assess the eligibility of expenditures when the SR&amp;ED claim is filed using the T661. For claims submitted through this elective process that require a financial review, which are not filed along with any non-pre-approved projects, the service standard is cut in half.</mark></p>
-->

<h2 id="h2">Other government funding for R&amp;D</h2>
<p>Other government R&amp;D funding and assistance will not prevent your work from being eligible for SR&amp;ED tax incentives, but they will reduce the amount of ITC you can earn.</p>
<p>For example, if you receive <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/support-technology-innovation/financial-support-technology-innovation-through-nrc-irap">NRC IRAP</a>, it will reduce the amount of ITC you can earn.</p>
<p>Provincial and territorial R&amp;D tax credits may also be available, although they will reduce the expenditures you can claim for SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p>You will need to report any funding or assistance you receive in your SR&amp;ED claim.</p>
